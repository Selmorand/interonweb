          <h1>What is AI Readiness?</h1>

          <p><strong>AI Readiness refers to how well your online presence can be understood by AI systems.</strong> This includes chatbots like ChatGPT, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, and AI-powered search features like Google's AI Overview.</p>

          <p>When these systems can clearly understand what your business does, they can recommend you to potential customers. When they can't, you become invisible to this growing discovery channel.</p>

          <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>

          <p>The way people find businesses is changing. Instead of just typing keywords into Google, people increasingly ask questions:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>"Who can fix my leaking roof in Sandton?"</li>
            <li>"What's the best Italian restaurant near me?"</li>
            <li>"Find me an accountant who specialises in small businesses"</li>
          </ul>

          <p>AI systems answer these questions by looking for businesses that clearly state what they do in a way machines can understand. If your website only has marketing fluff and vague language, AI systems struggle to determine what you actually offer.</p>

          <h2>The Problem: Human vs Machine Reading</h2>

          <p>Humans and machines read websites very differently.</p>

          <p><strong>What humans see:</strong> Design, images, emotional language, brand personality.</p>

          <p><strong>What machines see:</strong> Text, HTML structure, and ideally, structured data that explicitly states facts.</p>

          <p>Consider this example:</p>

          <blockquote>
            "Welcome to ABC Company! With over 25 years of excellence, we're committed to delivering quality solutions that exceed expectations. Our dedicated team brings passion and expertise to every project."
          </blockquote>

          <p>A human might think this sounds professional. But what does a machine learn? Almost nothing useful. It doesn't know:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What industry this company is in</li>
            <li>What services they actually provide</li>
            <li>Where they operate</li>
            <li>Who their customers are</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Makes a Business AI Ready?</h2>

          <p>An AI-ready website has:</p>

          <h3>1. Structured Data (Schema Markup)</h3>
          <p>This is machine-readable code that explicitly tells AI systems facts about your business. Think of it like a nutrition label for your website. <a href="/learn/schema.html">Learn more about schema markup</a>.</p>

          <h3>2. Clear, Direct Content</h3>
          <p>Instead of vague marketing language, your content clearly states what you do, who you serve, and where you operate.</p>

          <h3>3. Answer-Ready Information</h3>
          <p>Content structured so AI systems can extract and cite specific answers. FAQ sections, clear service descriptions, and direct statements all help.</p>

          <h3>4. Technical Foundation</h3>
          <p>Basic SEO hygiene: proper titles, descriptions, heading structure, and fast loading. AI systems still rely on these fundamentals.</p>

          <h2>A Simple Example</h2>

          <p><strong>Before (not AI ready):</strong></p>
          <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Smith &amp; Sons! We've been proudly serving
the community since 1985 with dedication and quality.&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

          <p><strong>After (AI ready):</strong></p>
          <pre><code>&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;
{
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",
  "name": "Smith & Sons Plumbing",
  "@type": "Plumber",
  "areaServed": "Cape Town",
  "telephone": "+27 21 555 0123",
  "priceRange": "$$"
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

          <p>Now AI systems know exactly what this business is, what it does, and where it operates.</p>

          <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>

          <h3>"I have good SEO, so I'm already AI ready"</h3>
          <p>Not necessarily. Traditional SEO focuses on keywords and rankings. AI Readiness requires structured data and clear, extractable information. They're related but different. <a href="/learn/seo.html">Read about the difference</a>.</p>

          <h3>"AI is only for big companies"</h3>
          <p>Actually, local businesses benefit most. When someone asks "Who can fix my boiler in Pretoria?", the AI needs to find local businesses with clear service information. Small businesses with good structured data can outperform bigger competitors who lack it.</p>

          <h3>"I can add AI stuff later"</h3>
          <p>You can, but businesses establishing AI Readiness now are building visibility that compounds over time. AI systems learn which sources provide reliable, structured information.</p>

          <h2>How to Check Your AI Readiness</h2>

          <p>Our free audit tool analyses your website across four categories:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>AI Readiness signals</strong> - Can machines understand your business?</li>
            <li><strong>Schema markup</strong> - Do you have structured data?</li>
            <li><strong>SEO fundamentals</strong> - Is your technical foundation solid?</li>
            <li><strong>GEO signals</strong> - Are you optimised for AI-generated answers?</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="text-center mt-4 mb-4">
            <a href="/audit.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Check Your AI Readiness</a>
          </div>
