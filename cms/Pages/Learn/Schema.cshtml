      <h1>Schema Markup Explained</h1>

      <p><strong>Schema markup is structured data that tells search engines and AI systems what your content actually means.</strong> Think of it as a nutrition label for your website - it provides machine-readable facts.</p>

      <h2>Why Schema Matters</h2>

      <p>Without schema, AI systems have to guess what your business does based on the text content. With schema, you explicitly tell them what you offer, where you're located, and what makes you special.</p>
