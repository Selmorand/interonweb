      <h1>What is AI Readiness?</h1>

      <p><strong>AI Readiness refers to how well your online presence can be understood by AI systems.</strong> This includes chatbots like ChatGPT, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, and AI-powered search features like Google's AI Overview.</p>

      <p>When these systems can clearly understand what your business does, they can recommend you to potential customers. When they can't, you become invisible to this growing discovery channel.</p>

      <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>

      <p>The way people find businesses is changing. Instead of just typing keywords into Google, people increasingly ask questions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>"Who can fix my leaking roof in Sandton?"</li>
        <li>"What's the best Italian restaurant near me?"</li>
        <li>"Find me an accountant who specialises in small businesses"</li>
      </ul>

      <p>AI systems answer these questions by looking for businesses that clearly state what they do in a way machines can understand. If your website only has marketing fluff and vague language, AI systems struggle to determine what you actually offer.</p>

      <h2>The Problem: Human vs Machine Reading</h2>

      <p>Humans and machines read websites very differently. Humans understand context, metaphors, and implications. Machines need explicit, structured information.</p>
