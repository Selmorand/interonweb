        <h2>What is AI Readiness?</h2>
        <p>When someone asks ChatGPT "Who can fix my roof in Cape Town?" or uses Google's AI Overview, these systems don't just search keywords. They look for businesses that clearly state what they do in a way machines can understand.</p>
        <p>AI Readiness means your website has:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Structured data</strong> that tells machines your business facts</li>
          <li><strong>Clear content</strong> that states what you offer</li>
          <li><strong>Schema markup</strong> that identifies your services</li>
          <li><strong>Machine-readable signals</strong> that AI can extract and cite</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without these elements, AI systems have to guess what your business does, and they often guess wrong or skip you entirely.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->

  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="prose" style="margin: 0 auto;">
      <h3>What is AI Readiness?</h3>
      <p>AI Readiness refers to how well your online presence can be understood by AI systems like ChatGPT, Google's AI Overview, and voice assistants. A machine-readable business has structured data that clearly tells AI what you do, what you offer, and how to recommend you.</p>

      <h3>Why does AI Readiness matter for my business?</h3>
      <p>AI systems are increasingly how people discover businesses. When someone asks ChatGPT or Google AI for recommendations, these systems look for businesses with clear, structured information. Without AI Readiness, your business may be invisible to these new discovery channels.</p>

      <h3>What does the free audit check?</h3>
      <p>Our free audit analyzes four key areas: AI Readiness signals (can machines understand your business), Schema markup (structured data implementation), SEO fundamentals (technical health), and GEO signals (Generative Engine Optimization). You receive a detailed report with specific recommendations.</p>

      <h3>What is schema markup?</h3>
      <p>Schema markup is structured data added to your website that helps search engines and AI systems understand your content. Think of it like a nutrition label for your website - it provides machine-readable facts about your business, services, products, and more using the Schema.org vocabulary.</p>
